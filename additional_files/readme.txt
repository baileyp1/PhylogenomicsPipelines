Downloaded from https://github.com/mossmatters/Angiosperms353 as Angiosperms353_targetSequences.fasta
Following change made:
Corrected seq ids so that they all conformed to: >organism-gene
i.e. two dash-separated fields only
Seqs with ambiguity codes [WNKRM] not removed

Expanded set of targets (155534 sequences) retrieved from the supplementary materials of the paper “A universal probe set for targeted sequencing of 353 nuclear genes from any flowering plant designed using k-medoids clustering” (https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.s3h9r6j). Angiosperm sequences were aligned, all columns with > 95% gap characters were removed, all sequences with < 50% of the alignment remaining removed, sequences were degapped.
