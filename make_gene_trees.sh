### NB - 28.1.2020 - now calculating this AFTER filtering for $maxColOcc and for > 3 seqs so it is directly comparable to lenLongestGeneAfterTrim
### 10.10.2019 - NBNB - the issue with this approach to calculating the longest gene is that some genes are much bigger than the majority of the alignment.
### BUT - I think the issue occurs with only a small number of seqs so I could calculate the median value for the top say 10 of seqs and use that value.
### Could print out the following stats here: longest gene, avrg and median of top 10%.
### NB - 13.1.2019 - this stat also counts longest gene for genes < ~100 bp maxColOcc - won;t make musch differecne but could move the calculation down to within the conditional!!


# Can now easily identify the number of columns occupied (ideally) by ALL seqs or at least a high proportion e.g. 70%.
# These columns will be the most informative ones for phylogeny, i.e. ones that are mostly occupied (being generous with 70 %):
###AMAS.py trim -f fasta -d $2 -t ${fractnMaxColOcc} -i $1 -o ${gene}_mafft_dna_aln_AMAS_${fractnMaxColOcc}.fasta
AMAS.py trim -f fasta -d $residueType -t ${fractnMaxColOcc} -i $1 -o ${gene}_${2}_aln_AMAS_trim_${fractnMaxColOcc}.fasta
###maxColOcc=`fastalength  ${gene}_mafft_dna_aln_AMAS_${fractnMaxColOcc}.fasta 2>/dev/null | sort -k1n | tail -n 1 | awk '{print $1}' `
maxColOcc=`fastalength  ${gene}_${2}_aln_AMAS_trim_${fractnMaxColOcc}.fasta 2>/dev/null | sort -k1n | tail -n 1 | awk '{print $1}' `
# NB - some seqs will have zero length seqs but the fastalength warning can go to /dev/null; using this command to check the occupancy but nothing more 
echo maxColOcc: $maxColOcc  >> ${geneId}_aln_summary.txt

### Old method and ideas:
# $maxColOcc needs to be at least 150 bp so that even the shortest seqs are ~100bp over the region.
# 150bp is length of the shortest target seqs (except for a few - looking at Angiosperm353 and plastid target seqs)
# Was also going to fail a gene if the $lenLongestGene : $maxColOcc ratio > 3x - would suggest that there is a likely issue with obtaining overlapping seqs:
# ratioLenOcc=`echo $length $maxOcc | awk '{printf "%.0f", $1/$2}' `
# However, then I'm relying on $lenLongestGene again and the are some issues with that (see above)   
# Just testing $maxColOcc should be OK.

### New change - 25.9.2020 - now allowing $maxColOcc to work down to zero so all genes can be included if desired.
# This completes the logic of this filtering approach: filtering genes at $fractnAlnCovrg across region of $maxColOcc, 
# the latter being filtered by $maxColOccThreshold set by user.
# NB - if there are no overlapping columns found for a gene, then this filtering is not possibe AND 
# the awk command will crash at $1/LENG if $maxColOcc and $3 are both zero
# So have created a separate conditional: elif [[ $maxColOcc -eq 0 && $3 -eq 0 ]]; then
# to allow the unfiltered alignment through when $maxColOcc==0 and option -O set by user is zero,
if [[ $maxColOcc -gt $3 ]]; then

	# Calculate the number of parsimonious columns (-p option) for the columns found from $maxColOcc:
	AMAS.py trim -f fasta -d dna -t $fractnMaxColOcc -p -i ${gene}_${2}_aln_AMAS_trim_${fractnMaxColOcc}.fasta -o ${gene}_${2}_aln_AMAS_trim_-p_${fractnMaxColOcc}.fasta
	maxParsCols=`fastalength ${gene}_${2}_aln_AMAS_trim_-p_${fractnMaxColOcc}.fasta 2>/dev/null | sort -k1n | tail -n 1 | awk '{print $1}' `
	echo maxParsCols: $maxParsCols >> ${geneId}_aln_summary.txt

	# Count total number of residues in the MCOT region here:
	totalResiduesInMaxColOccRegion=`fastalength ${gene}_${2}_aln_AMAS_trim_${fractnMaxColOcc}.fasta 2>/dev/null | awk '{sum+=$1} END {print sum}' `
	echo totalResiduesInMaxColOccRegion: $totalResiduesInMaxColOccRegion >> ${geneId}_aln_summary.txt

	# Now find the lengths of each sequence in bases only (not dashes!)
	# and create a list of sequences that are >= $fractnAlnCovrg across $maxColOcc region
	# NB - this code works because, luckily for this case, fastalength ignores dash characters (unlike seqtk used above)!

	# Note if .fasta file is empty, fastalength still exits normally.

### 19.8.2020 - consider to do this: else if < $maxColOcc just remove seqs below seqLenThreshold abd continue with same file as above but no filtering with $fractnAlnCovrg

	# Get seqs with ideal coverage, except, if this seq list file made just above 
	# only has 3 or less seqs then there is also no point in making a gene tree.

	if [ "$numbrSeqs" -gt 3 ]; then 		# Conditonal here not essential - but don't know how AMAS.py behaves with empty input files so leaving in here
											# Actually now using to print out filename if it fails
											### 27.8.2020 - can improve this check; if possible leave it to the main code to not build tree if < 3 seqs after all filtering checks 
											### For now have just repeated the identical warning message at this stage as well
											### 8.9.2020 - thinking further, this conditional should be removed but still check if numbrSeqs < 3 so I can print out alns
											###				Also still print out alns with maxColOcc < 30 separately
### 28.9.2020 - now I'm thinking that I should still keep it:
### 1. saves producing files that don't get usec for tree 
### 2. don't then have to check the files when trimming as they will be empty... - check this!

	#    NB - using ">" ensures that I don't also grep out a species id: grep -A1 ">$gene" \
	#	 Improvement: current grep now matches whole words so can have gene identifiers
	#                 e.g. 50, 506 and 5064 and they won't pick each other out (BUT these chars count as word endings: '.'  '/' ) - NB 26.11.2020 - therefore may want to recheck after this step for multiple seqs with the same gene ID   
	# 2. print seqs for current gene to a separate file
	# 3. reorganise the fasta header so that species info is next to '>' and the gene id is removed (required to run in coalescence)

# At the end of all filtering and trimming steps, the file entering the 
# makeGeneTree subroutine, assess_gene_alignments.sh and run_treeshrink_and_realign.sh
# has to have the same name. Currently this is: ${gene}.protein.aln.for_tree.fasta i.e.
# it needs to be known upfront.
# So just need to move/copy the final output filename and variable to the above name after
# adding any other filtering or trimming step - now doing this below just before tree building.

### UPDATE THERSE NOTES TO EXPLAIN FINAL LOGIC
										#		Also now thinking of removing *aln.for_tree.fasta and the *.nwk file before running wrapper script - 25.9.2020 - I think I did this - check
										### 10.8.2020 - alternatively, could have a condisitonal to set $maxColOcc to 0 if maxColOcc is not used if filterSeqs is OFF
										###             need to think further - I think you set it to 91 not 0 then all seqs will go through!
